The goal is to help beginners understand how networking works in the cloud, and how different components connect together to form a secure, controlled environment.\nYou will create a VPC with two subnets:\nA Public Subnet – allows resources (like EC2 instances) to access the Internet directly. A Private Subnet – isolated from the public Internet by default for better security. To enable the private subnet to download packages and access online services without being exposed publicly, you will configure:\nAn Internet Gateway (IGW) – allows public subnet traffic to flow to/from the Internet. An NAT Gateway – lets instances in the private subnet access the Internet indirectly, without assigning a public IP. By the end, you will spin up two EC2 instances — one in each subnet — and test communication between them while observing the role of routing and gateways.\nThis hands-on workshop teaches essential AWS networking fundamentals through guided steps and console navigation. Perfect for beginners who want to build confidence working with VPCs.\n"},{"uri":"https://BaoMinhTranHuynh.github.io/aws-intern-report/3-blogstranslated/3.1-blog1/","title":"Blog 1","tags":[],"description":"","content":" ⚠️ Note: The information below is for reference purposes only.

Part 2 of this series introduces two complementary architectural patterns for Generative AI workflows that do not require immediate response, ideal for time-consuming tasks or scheduled, large-scale data processing: Buffered Asynchronous Processing and Non-Interactive Batch Processing.\nPattern 4: Buffered Asynchronous Request Response This pattern uses event-driven architectures to handle long-running requests (e.g., video generation, scientific analysis) to increase scalability and reliability.\nREST API with Message Queuing: The frontend sends a request via API Gateway which is buffered into Amazon SQS. Middleware (Lambda/EC2/Fargate) processes the messages in batches, calls the LLM, saves the result to DynamoDB, and the frontend polls for the response.\nWebSocket API with Message Queuing: A variation using the API Gateway WebSocket API. Once processed, the middleware actively sends the result back to the client immediately (no polling required) through the WebSocket connection.\nPattern 5: Multimodal Parallel Fan-Out This pattern is applied when interacting with multiple LLMs, data sources, or agents. It uses a fan-out mechanism via Amazon EventBridge or Amazon SNS to distribute specific messages to multiple targets in parallel, breaking down and executing complex sub-tasks simultaneously to minimize overall generation time.\nPattern 6: Non-Interactive Batch Processing Ideal for efficiently processing large datasets on a schedule or event-driven basis (e.g., batch image optimization, periodic report generation). This pattern uses services like AWS Step Functions or AWS Glue to build serverless data processing and inferencing pipelines, optimizing resource usage and increasing throughput.

IN-DEPTH KNOWLEDGE BY THE 5 PILLARS 1. Security Foundation \u0026amp; Core Principles Core Principles: Emphasis on the necessity of Least Privilege, Zero Trust (never trust, always verify), and Defense in Depth (layered defense).\nShared Responsibility Model: Clarifying the boundary of responsibility: AWS is responsible for the security of the Cloud (infrastructure, physical), while the Customer is responsible for security in the Cloud (data, IAM, configuration).\n2. Pillar 1: Identity \u0026amp; Access Management (IAM) Modern Architecture: Avoid using long-term credentials (long-lived Access Keys) for users. Prioritize Roles for services and IAM Identity Center (SSO) for users.\nMulti-Account Control: Apply Service Control Policies (SCPs) at the AWS Organizations level and Permission Boundaries to set maximum limits for delegated permissions.\nMini Demo: Demonstration of using Access Analyzer and the policy simulator tool to verify and validate access rights before deployment.\n3. Pillar 2: Detection Continuous Monitoring: Utilize CloudTrail (at the Organization level) to log all API actions, GuardDuty for ML-powered abnormal threat detection, and Security Hub to aggregate findings.\nDetection-as-Code: Defining detection rules as code (e.g., Lambda, CloudFormation) to automate deployment and management.\n4. Pillar 3: Infrastructure Protection Network Segmentation: Separate application tiers (Web, App, DB) using VPC segmentation. Clearly distinguish the roles of Security Groups (stateful) and NACLs (stateless).\nPerimeter Defense: Deploy WAF (Web Application Firewall) and Shield to protect applications against DDoS and Layer 7 attacks.\n5. Pillar 4: Data Protection Encryption: Ensure data is encrypted both at-rest (stored in S3, EBS, RDS) and in-transit (transmitted via TLS/SSL).\nKey and Secrets Management: Use KMS (Key Management Service) to manage primary encryption keys, control key policies, and key rotation. Use Secrets Manager to store and automatically rotate secrets (database passwords, API keys).\n6. Pillar 5: Incident Response IR Lifecycle: Guidance on adhering to the AWS standard lifecycle (Prepare, Detect, Respond, Recover).\nResponse Automation: Develop automated Playbooks using Lambda or Step Functions for common incidents like compromised IAM keys or EC2 malware detection. Key steps include Snapshot, isolation, and evidence collection.\nEvent Photos.

Please do not copy verbatim for your report, including this warning.\nIn this section, you need to summarize the contents of the workshop that you plan to conduct.\nProposal – Smart Resume Analyzer A Unified AWS Serverless solution to analyze CVs vs JDs and generate Fit Scores\nNote: This proposal follows the sectioning style of your previous _index.md sample but is rewritten for the Smart Resume Analyzer project.\n1.Executive Summary Smart Resume Analyzer is a serverless web platform that evaluates the match between a candidate’s CV and a Job Description (JD). It calculates a Fit Score, detects skill gaps, and provides personalized learning suggestions.\nThe solution is implemented by a 5‑member team in 4 weeks on AWS using managed, pay‑as‑you‑go services to keep costs near zero for a demo workload. The UI is built with Next.js and hosted on AWS Amplify; the backend uses API Gateway + Lambda with DynamoDB, S3, Comprehend, Textract, and Cognito.\nKey outcomes\n90% faster CV screening for demo scenarios. Objective Fit Score with visual reports. Actionable learning roadmap per candidate. 2.Problem Statement 2.1 What’s the problem? Recruiters spend significant time manually reading CVs and comparing them to JDs. Candidates lack insight into which skills they are missing and how to improve. Existing tools are expensive or not tailored for Vietnamese/SEA use cases. 2.2 The solution Upload CV (PDF/DOCX) and JD → automatic text extraction and NLP. Detect skills, experience, education; compute Fit Score vs JD. Recommend skill pathways mapped from a small SkillOntology store. Secure login with Cognito; results shown in a clean Next.js dashboard. 3.Solution Architecture (overview) Serverless, event‑driven architecture on AWS.\nMain components\nFrontend: Next.js UI (Amplify Hosting) for upload \u0026amp; result dashboard. API Layer: Amazon API Gateway → AWS Lambda functions. Processing: parseResume → Textract (if scanned PDF) → normalized text. nlpAnalyze → Comprehend → entities/skills/phrases. recommendSkills → compares to JD + SkillOntology in DynamoDB. Data: DynamoDB (results, ontology), S3 (temporary CV/JD). Identity: Cognito (JWT access tokens). Ops: IaC with AWS SAM, CI/CD via CodeBuild + CodePipeline, logging in CloudWatch. (A Mermaid architecture diagram is provided separately.)\n4.Technical Implementation 4.1 Tech stack Backend: .NET 8 (C# Minimal API on Lambda) Frontend: Next.js + TailwindCSS (Amplify Hosting) AWS: Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, Cognito, Comprehend, Textract IaC: AWS SAM CI/CD: CodeBuild + CodePipeline 4.2 End‑to‑end flow User authenticates via Cognito and obtains JWT. Frontend requests presigned URL to S3 → uploads CV/JD. API Gateway invokes Lambda parseResume: If PDF scan → Textract → extract text; otherwise direct parse. Clean \u0026amp; normalize → store interim artifacts on S3. Lambda nlpAnalyze uses Comprehend to detect entities/skills → writes results to DynamoDB. Lambda recommendSkills loads SkillOntology from DynamoDB → compares CV vs JD → computes Fit Score + gaps. Frontend queries results via API → renders charts/tables. 4.3 Data model (DynamoDB – simplified) Table Profiles (PK: userId, SK: profileId) – store latest CV parse. Table Analyses (PK: analysisId) – fit score, gaps, timestamps. Table SkillOntology (PK: skillId, attributes: name, tags, learningPath[]). 4.4 API (high level) POST /upload-url → presign for CV/JD. POST /analyze → triggers pipeline for a given S3 key pair. GET /analyses/{id} → returns Fit Score \u0026amp; recommendations. GET /skills/{id} → (optional) fetch a skill’s learning path. 5.Timeline \u0026amp; Milestones (4 weeks) Week Milestone Deliverables 1 Foundation SAM template, DynamoDB tables, Cognito, base UI 2 Parsing \u0026amp; NLP parseResume, nlpAnalyze, JD parsing, unit tests 3 Recommender \u0026amp; FE integration recommendSkills, dashboard, charts 4 Demo \u0026amp; hardening E2E tests, logging, cost tuning, slide deck 6.Budget Estimation (demo scale) Indicative, assuming \u0026lt; 500 requests/month\nLambda: ~$0.02 API Gateway: ~$0.01 S3 (few GB, low requests): ~$0.10 DynamoDB (on‑demand, low R/W): ~$0.05 Amplify Hosting: ~$0.30 Comprehend + Textract (small pages): ~$0.40 Cognito: $0.00\nTotal ≈ $0.9 / month (~$10 / year) 7.Security, Risks \u0026amp; Mitigations Security\nPrivate S3 buckets with SSE‑KMS; presigned uploads only. IAM least privilege; API protected by Cognito JWT. PII masking for logs; CloudWatch alarms. Optional: set lifecycle rules to delete raw CV/JD after analysis. Risks \u0026amp; mitigations\nNLP accuracy: Provide supported formats + fallback to keyword rules. Large/unclean CVs: Validate size/format; sanitize before NLP. Cost spikes: AWS Budget alarms; cap page counts per request. 8.Expected Outcomes Automated CV‑JD matching with transparent Fit Score. Visual breakdown of skills matched vs gaps and learning roadmap. Serverless, low‑ops stack that’s easy to demo, extend, and localize. 📄 Proposal Document (Google Docs) 👉 Review Proposal here:\nGOOGLE DOC LINK\n"},{"uri":"https://BaoMinhTranHuynh.github.io/aws-intern-report/1-worklog/1.10-week10/","title":"Week 10 Worklog","tags":[],"description":"","content":" ⚠️ Note: The following information is for reference purposes only.

Modern development teams are pressured to deliver high-quality code faster, often hindered by \u0026ldquo;toil\u0026rdquo;—manual, repetitive, and low-value work. Amazon Q Developer helps reduce this toil, but measuring its real impact requires looking at the entire Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). The integration combines Amazon Q Developer\u0026rsquo;s AI usage data with other technical metrics using Jellyfish, an Engineering Management solution. This provides engineering leaders with a holistic view to measure impact (e.g., track reduction in time from first commit to Pull Request) and monitor adoption across the team, enabling data-driven decisions on AI investment.\nBlog 2 - Now Available – AWS Systems Manager for SAP Configuration Management: Automated Validation of SAP HANA Best Practices This blog announces the launch of AWS Systems Manager for SAP Configuration Management, a new feature that enables automated validation of SAP HANA database configurations against AWS-recommended best practices (based on the SAP Lens of the AWS Well-Architected Framework). This feature helps SAP administrators detect potential configuration drifts and ensure optimal performance, security, and reliability for SAP HANA workloads running on AWS. The Configuration Checks focus on key areas like EC2 Instance Type Selection, EBS Storage Configuration, and Pacemaker HA Setup. The feature supports both manual and scheduled automation checks via API, with results providing detailed status (OKAY, ERROR, WARNING, INFO) and remediation guidance.\nBlog 3 - Generative AI Architectural Patterns – Part 2 (Non-Real-Time) This part of the series introduces architectural patterns for Generative AI workflows that do not require immediate response, ideal for time-consuming tasks or scheduled, large-scale data processing. The two main approaches covered are Buffered Asynchronous Processing and Non-Interactive Batch Processing. Key patterns include: Buffered Asynchronous Request Response (using API Gateway/WebSocket API with Amazon SQS and DynamoDB for long-running tasks), Multimodal Parallel Fan-Out (using Amazon SNS/EventBridge to distribute tasks to multiple LLMs/agents), and Non-Interactive Batch Processing (using AWS Step Functions or AWS Glue for scheduled data processing and inferencing).
