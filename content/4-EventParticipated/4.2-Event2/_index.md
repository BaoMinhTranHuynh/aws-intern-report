## MORNING SESSION (8:30 AM – 12:00 PM): CI/CD & INFRASTRUCTURE AS CODE

### 1. Welcome & DevOps Mindset (8:30 – 9:00 AM)
* The event began with a **quick recap** from the previous AI/ML session, setting the context for moving models/applications into production.
* The focus was on **DevOps culture and principles**, emphasizing collaboration between Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops).
* Introduction to **key performance metrics** such as **DORA** (Deployment Frequency, Lead Time for Changes, MTTR, Change Failure Rate) and **MTTR** (Mean Time To Recovery).

### 2. AWS DevOps Services – Building the CI/CD Pipeline (9:00 – 10:30 AM)
This section delved into the AWS CodeFamily suite of tools to automate **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)**:
* **Source Control:** Using **AWS CodeCommit** and discussing source code management strategies like **GitFlow** and **Trunk-based**.
* **Build & Test:** Configuring **CodeBuild** to automate compilation and running testing pipelines.
* **Deployment:** Analyzing advanced deployment strategies with **CodeDeploy**, including **Blue/Green, Canary, and Rolling updates**.
* **Orchestration:** Utilizing **CodePipeline** to automate the entire process from commit to production.
* **Demo:** A visual demonstration of a complete CI/CD pipeline on AWS.

### 3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) (10:45 AM – 12:00 PM)
IaC is the foundation of modern DevOps, ensuring environment consistency and reproducibility:
* **AWS CloudFormation:** Learning about **Templates, Stacks,** and how to use **Drift Detection** to identify discrepancies between the actual state and the source code.
* **AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit):** Introducing CDK as a more modern approach, using familiar programming languages (TypeScript, Python,...) to define infrastructure via **Constructs** and **reusable patterns**.
* **Demo & Discussion:** Demonstrating infrastructure deployment using both CloudFormation and CDK, along with a discussion on criteria for choosing the right IaC tool.

## AFTERNOON SESSION (1:00 PM – 5:00 PM): CONTAINER, OBSERVABILITY & BEST PRACTICES

### 4. Container Services on AWS (1:00 – 2:30 PM)
* **Docker Fundamentals:** Review of basic concepts related to **Microservices** and **Containerization**.
* **Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry):** The service for storing container images, including **image scanning** features and **lifecycle policies**.
* **Amazon ECS & EKS:** Comparing the two main container orchestration services: **ECS** (simpler, AWS integrated) and **EKS** (Kubernetes-based). Analysis of deployment and scaling strategies.
* **AWS App Runner:** A simplified solution for container deployment, focusing on code over infrastructure.
* **Demo & Case Study:** Illustrating microservices architecture deployment and comparing the services.

### 5. Monitoring & Observability (2:45 – 4:00 PM)
* **CloudWatch:** The core tool for collecting **metrics, logs, alarms, and dashboards** across the entire AWS ecosystem.
* **AWS X-Ray:** Provides **Distributed Tracing** to track request flow across microservices, helping to identify bottlenecks and performance issues.
* **Demo:** Setting up a comprehensive observability system (Full-stack observability).
* **Best Practices:** Best practices for **Alerting, dashboards,** and the **on-call** process.

### 6. DevOps Best Practices & Case Studies (4:00 – 4:45 PM)
* **Advanced Deployment Strategies:** Discussion on **Feature flags** and **A/B testing** within the deployment pipeline.
* **Automated testing** and deep integration with CI/CD.
* **Incident Management:** Managing incidents and the importance of **Postmortems** for learning and improvement.
* **Case Studies:** Lessons learned from startups and large enterprises that have undergone successful DevOps transformations.

### 7. Q&A & Wrap-up (4:45 – 5:00 PM)
* Addressing in-depth questions.
* Providing information on **DevOps career pathways** and relevant AWS certifications.
