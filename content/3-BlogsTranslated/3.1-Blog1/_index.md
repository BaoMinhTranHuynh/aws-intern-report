### Blog 1 - Measuring Developer Productivity with Amazon Q Developer and Jellyfish.
This blog guides you on how to integrate Amazon Q Developer with Jellyfish to effectively measure the impact of generative AI on developer productivity. Modern development teams are pressured to deliver high-quality code faster, often hindered by "toil"—manual, repetitive, and low-value work. Amazon Q Developer helps reduce this toil, but measuring its real impact requires looking at the entire Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

The integration combines Amazon Q Developer's AI usage data with other technical metrics using Jellyfish, an Engineering Management solution. This provides engineering leaders with a holistic view to:

Measure Impact: Track the reduction in time from first commit to Pull Request (e.g., a reported 24% reduction) and the increase in velocity (e.g., a 142% increase in average monthly Pull Requests per user).

Monitor Adoption: Visualize the number of engineers using the tool, categorized into Power, Casual, Idle, and New users.

Analyze Investment (ROI): Understand how AI investment impacts different areas like Growth, Keep The Lights On (KTLO), and Support.

The article also provides a detailed Implementation Guide for setting up the data pipeline via an Amazon S3 bucket and granting secure access to Jellyfish using IAM roles, enabling data-driven decisions on AI investment.
