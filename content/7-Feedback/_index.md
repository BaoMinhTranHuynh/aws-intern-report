**1. Working Environment**

The working environment is incredibly friendly and open. FCJ members are always willing to assist whenever I encounter difficulties, even outside of working hours. The workspace is tidy and comfortable, which aids my focus.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**

My mentor provides detailed guidance, explains concepts clearly, and always encourages questions. The admin team facilitates administrative tasks efficiently, provides necessary documentation, and creates favorable conditions for effective work. I especially appreciate that my mentor encourages me to solve problems independently before providing the answers.

The company culture is highly positive; everyone respects one another and maintains a professional yet enjoyable atmosphere. During urgent projects, the entire team collaborates and supports each other regardless of position. This made me feel like an integral part of the team, even as an intern.
